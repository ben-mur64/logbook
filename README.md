# Purchase Logbook

Once upon a time, I worked for the BYU Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
I was asked to make a better purchase log that the one we currently had, that would allow users to log purchases.
In the end, partly due to feature creep, partly due to my own experience with web development, I never finished the project before I left that employment.
This site, for BYU CS 260, is what that project was meant to be.
